# Pointcept-Bracket â€” Regression for Bracket Installation Point Prediction

**Pointcept-Bracket** is a customized fork of [Pointcept](https://github.com/Pointcept/Pointcept), fine-tuned for **regression-based prediction of bracket installation points** on 3D data.  
This repository extends the original Pointcept framework with specialized components for regression tasks, evaluation, and visualization.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- **Custom Regression Model**  
  A modified version of the Pointcept architecture adapted for *continuous* output prediction instead of classification.

- **Two Custom Configuration Files**  
  Tailored YAML configuration files optimized for bracket point regression workflows.

- **Custom Tester: `BracketTester`**  
  A dedicated evaluation script that computes performance metrics for regression outputs (e.g., MSE, MAE, and spatial error).

- **Enhanced Plotting & Visualization Scripts**  
  Tools for visualizing predicted vs. ground-truth bracket locations and generating regression result plots.

- **Full Integration with Pointcept**  
  Retains compatibility with Pointceptâ€™s modular design, dataloaders, and training utilities.
